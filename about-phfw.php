Port Harcourt Hitherto have been known as the Oil rich city and youths who could not find themselves in the oil and gas sector felt out of place. That narrative needed to change and we were able to achieve it through the Master classes facilitated by veterans of the Fashion industry, Lexy Mojo Eyes, Frank Osodi, international celebrity makeup artist, Marco Louis of MAC cosmetics Africa, entrepreneurship coach and formal president of the Port Harcourt Chamber of Commerce Engr. Emeka Unachukwu and Mrs Gift Nwankwo.</p>
