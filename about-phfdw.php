Port Harcourt Hitherto have been known as the Oil rich city and youths who could not find themselves in the oil and gas sector felt out of place. That narrative needed to change and we were able to achieve it through the Master classes facilitated by veterans of the Fashion Industry, Lexy Mojo Eyes, Frank Osodi, celebrity makeup artist, Marco Louis who came all the way from South Africa to teach and inspire our youths, entrepreneurship coach and formal president of the Port Harcourt Chamber of Commerce Engr. Emeka Unachukwu and Mrs Gift Nwankwo.</p>
